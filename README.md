# Prework - *ColorChange*

Submitted by: **Matin Bari**

**ColorChange** is an app that has three labels and a button that can change the background's color to a random color each time it is pressed. 

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps and Their Features:
1. Twitter (X): User Polls, Twitter Spaces, Lists
2. Facebook: Marketplace, Messenger, Memories
3. Threads: Dark Mode, Instagram Integration, Privacy Controls

An improvement I have for Twitter is bookmark collections. It can be similar to how users can save posts on Instagram and organize them into different collections. Bookmarks on Twitter are just in one list, so it would be useful to separate them into the user's own categories so they can view their bookmarks in a more organized matter. Another improvement I have is for Meta-owned apps. Images and videos can have low quality when they are shared. I think this can be improved if there is user customization with data compression. 

## Notes

The main challenges were just adapting to Xcode and the Swift language. I had to learn how to properly navigate Xcode and the files. However, once I was able to use it for an hour, I was able to successfully complete the prework.
